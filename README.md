# letter-notes-parser
Parsing the letter notes over from pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/ into an array form with numbers representing frequencies. Also one of my early projects, but I'm kinda proud of this one. As always with my early projects, link to original here: https://repl.it/@AlekseiTerin/ParsingForCircuitPlayground#main.py
